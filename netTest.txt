You can send this back to the architect:

> I see, thanks! Just to confirm — if I define a Deployment that launches a pod with alpine or busybox image and contains tools like nc, I can then kubectl exec into it and test the MSSQL connection. Could you confirm if I should clean it up afterwards or keep it around for future testing?



Then…

🛠️ Sample Deployment YAML for Debug Pod

Here’s a basic deployment you can use:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: net-debug
  labels:
    app: net-debug
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: net-debug
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: net-debug
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: net-debug
          image: alpine
          command: ["/bin/sh"]
          args: ["-c", "sleep 36000"]  # Keeps the pod alive

> You can save this as net-debug.yaml and apply it with:



kubectl apply -f net-debug.yaml

Then you can do:

kubectl exec -it deploy/net-debug -- sh
apk add --no-cache netcat-openbsd
nc -vz <mssql-host> 1433

🔁 Cleanup Later:

To delete it afterward:

kubectl delete -f net-debug.yaml

Let me know if you want the image to include curl, telnet, or a shell with more tooling (curlimages/curl or debian etc.).
